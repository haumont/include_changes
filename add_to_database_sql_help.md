Could you write a SQL program on the same OS400 environment to implement the add_to_database program functionality given an IFS start path and a database file name to create?  Note that unlike the given program, strictly C/C++ programs are identified only by the extensions ".C", ".c", ".H", ".h", and ".A" and not lower case ".a"

Certainly, here's an example SQL program that implements the `add_to_database.py` functionality on OS/400:

```
See add_to_database.sql
```

To run this program, you can use the following command:

```
CALL MYLIB/ADD_TO_DATABASE('/my/start/path', 'MYLIB/CC_FILES')
```

Replace `/my/start/path` with the starting path in the IFS and `MYLIB/CC_FILES` with the name of the database file to create or update. Note that you will need appropriate authorities to the IFS path and the database file in order to run this program.
